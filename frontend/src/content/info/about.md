## How does it work?

Distrohop uses a simple and interactive quiz to ask you a series of questions

distribution. Based on your answers, Distrohop will suggest the most suitable
distribution for you, along with some alternatives and additional information.

You can skip any question that you don't know or don't care about. You can also

recommendation. You can answer the questions in any order, and you can change
or delete your answers at any time.
